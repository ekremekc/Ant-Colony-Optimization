# Ant-Colony-Optimization
This repository includes Travelling Salesman problem implementation of Ant Colony Optimization.

Implemented code can be executed by using **aco.py** file. This file uses distance **matrix from aco_distances.xlsx** and creates pheromone matrix. Then by using probability analysis, the next city is selected by using quite popular **roulette wheel** method based on the updated pheromone matrix for each city. At the end of the each iteration, best ant route is saved and displayed as a plot.
